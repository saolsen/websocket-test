Full App
========

A live real time music jamming app in the browser.

Phase 1
-------

* Users connect to a really fast node server thats hopefully somewhere
  between the two of them. This routes messages over socket.io and if
  it works will hopefully allow real time jamming. If the latency is
  too high the whole project is a bust.
  I'll make some really simple js instruments for them to play or
  something.

Phase 2
--------

* Set up a nice javascript API for creating instruments so that people
  that are better at design and js than myself can make some baller
  instruments to play. Give them full access to overtone sounds or
  something so people make some awesome stuff.

Phase 3
--------

* Set up a cool matchmaking site for finding other people to jam with,
  also save everything everyone is playing all the time so that later
  they can get recordings of it and we can do some really fun
  analyitics. We'll be able to show things to them while they are
  jamming like the key they are in and the chord progression and stuff
  like that. Can also profile people by the type of music they like to
  play to help with the matchmaking.
