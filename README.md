Testing websockets and socket.io

My plan is to build a real time music jamming app, but for that to happen
I'll need super crazy fast communication between web browsers. Not sure if
something like this is viable yet but I guess I'll find out.

Step 1) Hook up some sockets!
Step 2) Figure out a realiable way to measure the latency
Step 3) see what the delay is in syncing audio.
